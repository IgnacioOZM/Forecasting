# Forecasting
This GitHub repository will track all of my projects regarding forecasting for my machine learning course.
Forecasting is a sub-discipline of prediction in which we are making predictions about the future, on the basis of time-series data.

In this course I will focus on the analysis of structured data with the implementation of multiple algorithms and studies:

* Decomposition
* Stochastic processes
* Exponential Smoothing methods
* ARIMA models & Seasonal ARIMA models
* Dynamic regression models
* Nonlinear time series models
